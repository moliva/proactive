A client/server example made using ProActive. In one window you
can launch the server using the script cs_server without
parameters. Then, in different windows, you can launch several
clients using the script cs_client and passing the name of the
client as a argument. Each client declares itself to the server
and sends messages. The server broadcasts the messages to all
referenced clients.
