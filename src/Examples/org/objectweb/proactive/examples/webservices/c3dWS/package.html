C3D is both a collaborative application and a distributed
raytracer: users can interact through messaging and voting
facilities in order to choose a scene that is being ray traced using a set
of distributed rendering engines working in parallel. Near-linear
speedup is achieved with up to half a dozen rendering engines
running in parallel and communicating using ProActive.
