This application illustrates the well-known <b>Dining
Philosophers</b> problem. This version is deadlock-free, as every
philosopher only takes both forks at the same time, thus
preventing everyone e having just one fork.
</p><p>
The solution presented here is built around a central <code><a href="Table.html">PhilosophersManager</a></code> object. 
The implementation only uses active objects local to
the VM the example is run on, therefore demonstrating how to write a
multithreaded program with ProActive. It features advanced
intra-object synchronization policies.
