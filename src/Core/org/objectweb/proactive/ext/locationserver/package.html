Defines a Body associated with a location server able to give the location of 
one body on demand.
</p><p>
In case of migration, a body leaves behind it a request forwarder that allows
other objects to communicate to the migrated body using the same remote reference 
they had before migration.
</p><p>
Another strategy than using a chain of forwarders is to use a server of locations
that is notified of the location of the body. Upon migration, a body notifies the
server of its new location. Other objects contact the server to locate a body that 
is not responding anymore.
