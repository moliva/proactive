Provides the cryptographic services.
</p>


<h3> CLASSPATH setup  </h3>

<p >
The org.objectweb.proactive.ext.security.crypto package requires the Legion of the Bouncy Castle JCE implementation. <br>

This package can be freely obtained at the following URL : <a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/"><b>http://www.bouncycastle.org/</b></a><br>

Make sure to download the good version (JCE 1.2.1 for the JDK 1.3).<br>

<b>Both packages are included with ProActive in the lib directory.</b>
</p>


<h3> Generation of the Certification Authority's Public/Private KeyPair  </h3>


<p >
The second step is to generate the Certification Authority's Public/Private key pair. This pair will act as a reference in
the security protocols. 
</p>


<p >
To generate the key pair just type : <br>
<br>

<b>java org.objectweb.proactive.ext.security.crypto.CertificationAuthority</b><br>
<br>

The key pair will be generated (It can take a couple of seconds) and saved in the current directory.<br>

The Certification Authority's private key will be saved in a file named : <b>acPrivateKey</b><br>

The Certification Authority's public  key will be saved in a file named : <b>acPublicKey</b><br>

Make sure that the private key is located in a safe place.<br>

The Certification Authority's private key sould only be used to generate the certificates of the domains (see step 3).<br>

Each domain must obtain a copy of the Certification Authority's public key.<br>

</p>


<h3> Certificates generation </h3>


<p >
The third step is to generate certificates for each domain of the ProActive Application.<br>
 
Each domain must contain a PrivateCertificate and a PublicCertificate. The certificates are required for the
authentication and the key negociation protocols.<br>

The org.objectweb.proactive.ext.security.crypto package provides a graphical class for the certificates generation.
To launch this interface just type :<br>
<br>

<b>java org.objectweb.proactive.ext.security.crypto.CertificateGenerator</b></p>

<img src="Certificate_Generator.jpg" alt="Certificate Generator" border="0">

<p><b>Screenshot of the graphical interface</b></p>

<p>You must then enter the following informations :</p>
<ul>
  <li> <i>Name of the domain :</i> The name that you wan't to give to the domain</li>
  <li> <i>Validity :</i> The number of days before the certificate expires</li>
  <li> <i>Save PublicCertificate to  :</i> The file in which you wan't to save the PublicCertificate</li>
  <li> <i>Save PrivateCertificate to :</i> The file in which you wan't to save the PrivateCertificate</li>
  <li> <i>AC PublicKey :</i> The file where the Certification Authority's public  key is stored (typically : acPublicKey)</li>
  <li> <i>AC PrivateKey :</i> The file where the Certification Authority's private  key is stored (typically : acPrivateKey)</li>
</ul>
<p>To generate the certificates, just press the button "Generate!". When
the certificate generation finishes (it can take a few seconds), the standard
output notices you the following message : "The Certificate Pair has been correctly generated and saved".<br>
</p>


<p>
<b>IMPORTANT</b>: if you don't specify absolutes paths for files, the certificates will be created in the current directory,
and the AC keys files will be searched in the current directory.
</p>


<h3> Certificates Management  </h3>


<p >
You can read the attributes of any certificate (private or public) with the following command :<br>
<br>

<b>java org.objectweb.proactive.ext.security.crypto.CertificateReader certificate_file</b><br>
<br>

Example of this command output :<br>
<br>

Type		: PublicCertificate<br>

Domain 		: www.inria.fr<br>

Delivered 	: Tue Jul 24 11:18:03 CEST 2001<br>

Expires 	: Wed Jul 24 11:18:03 CEST 2002<br>

<br>

IMPORTANT : if you decide to generate a new Certification Authority's key pair, you must be awarared that all the
certificates generated with the previous Certification Authority's key pair will become invalid.<br>
 
</p>

<h3> SecureNodes launching </h3>


<p >
The last step is to launch the SecureNodes on each domain. To do this type :<br>

<b>java org.objectweb.proactive.rmi.StartSecureNode //oriens/SNode1 public_certifFile private_certifFile
acPublicKeyFile &amp;</b><br>

The distributed ProActive Application is now ready to be launched !<br>
