This package contains classes related to component requests. Component requests are requests
addressed to components and are extensions of standard ProActive requests.
</p>
<p>
This package also holds classes to help optimize the transfer of requests thanks to a shortcutting
mechanism.
</p>
<p>This package used to hold the code for a custom request queue for components, that was used
for managing the lifecycle of the components. This has now been replaced by a more generic mechanism
in the org.objectweb.proactive.core.Service class.
