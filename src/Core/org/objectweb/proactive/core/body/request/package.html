Defines the request messages based of the common message layer. A Request is a message 
embedding a method call issued on an active object. It is used by the
body and its components to communicate. All requests eventually come to the body that 
will process them one by one using the active thread and triggering a call on the
reified object. 
</p><p>
All upcomming requests are stored in the RequestQueue attached to the body
waiting to be processed. It is by using that request queue that one can setup complex
synchronization policies in the custom live method of an active object. Several interfaces
(<a href="RequestFilter.html">RequestFilter</a> or <a href="RequestProcessor.html">RequestProcessor</a>)
provide fine control over the request queue.
</p><p>
In addition to the request messages, this package defines two conponents of the body 
(RequestSender and RequestReceiver) in charge of sending and receiving requests.
