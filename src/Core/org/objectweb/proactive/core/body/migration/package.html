Defines the migration primitive of ProActive. Any active object, as long as its graph of passive objects is serializable,
is potentially migratable. It is the body associated to the active object that makes the migration possible. The 
<a href="AbstractMigratableBody.html">AbstractMigratableBody</a>
is an abstract body used for the migration. The body of migratable object should inherit from this one. The effective migration is 
actually delegatated to a <a href="MigrationManager.html">MigrationManager</a> also defined in this package.
