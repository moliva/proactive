Provides the ProActive Network Protocol, PNP
</p>

<p>
PNP is a communication protocol for ProActive. It's purpose is to replace RMI as the default
communication protocol. Indeed RMI has some severe limitations for our use:
<ul>
	<li>Not firewall/NAT friendly (use a lot unpredictable TCP port)</li>
	<li>Does not support timeout</li>
	<li>Not scalable due to massive thread number</li>
</ul>

<p>
PNP tries to address all theses limitations will being simple, lightweight and efficient
