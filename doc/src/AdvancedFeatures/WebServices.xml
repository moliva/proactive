    <para>This feature allows to expose an active object as a web service and thus, to call it
    from any client written in any foreign language.</para>

    <para>Indeed, applications written in C#, for instance, cannot communicate
    with ProActive applications. We have chosen web services technology to
    enable interoperability because they are based on XML and HTTP. Thus, any
    active object can be accessible from any enabled web services language.</para>

    <para>A <emphasis role="bold">web service</emphasis> is a software entity,
    providing one or several functionalities, that can be exposed, discovered
    and accessed over the network. Moreover, web services technology allows
    heterogeneous applications to communicate and exchange data in a remotely
    way. In our case, the useful elements of web services are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">The SOAP Message</emphasis></para>

        <indexterm>
          <primary>SOAP</primary>
        </indexterm>

        <para>The SOAP message is used to exchange XML based data over the
        internet. It can be sent via HTTP and provides a serialization format
        for communicating over a network.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">The HTTP Server</emphasis></para>

        <para>HTTP is the standard web protocol generally used over the 80
        port. In order to receive SOAP messages, you can either install an HTTP
        server that will be responsible of the data transfer or use the default HTTP server
		  which is a Jetty server. However, This server is not sufficient to treat a SOAP request.
		  For this, you also need a SOAP engine.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">The SOAP Engine</emphasis></para>

        <para>A SOAP Engine is the mechanism responsible of making transparent
        the unmarshalling of the request and the marshalling of the response.
        Thus, the service developer doesn't have to worry with SOAP.
		In our case, we use Apache CXF which can be installed into any HTTP server.
		  </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">The client</emphasis></para>

        <para>Client's role is to consume a web service. It is the producer of
        the SOAP message. The client developer does not have to worry about how
        the service is implemented. The CXF java library provides classes to
		  easily invoke a service (see examples).</para>

  <para>
  If you want to expose your active objects on the local embedded Jetty server or on Jetty servers deployed during your deployment, you just have to deploy proactive using
  the <literal>build deploy</literal> command into the <literal>compile</literal> directory. If you want to expose them on an other http
  server, you have to build the <literal>proactive.war</literal> archive.
  For this, you have to go into your <literal>compile</literal> directory of your ProActive home and type <literal>build proActiveWar</literal>.
  The <literal>proactive.war</literal> file will be built into the <literal>dist/</literal> directory.</para>

  <para>If you have chosen to use the default Jetty server, then you have nothing else to do. Jetty server will automatically take files it needs.</para>

  <para>If you have chosen to use your own HTTP server, then you just have to copy the proactive.war file into the <literal>webapp/</literal> directory of your HTTP server.
  Some HTTP servers need to be restarted to take into account
  this new web application but some others like Tomcat can handle hot deployment and, thus, do not need to be restarted.</para>

  <warning>
  <para>If you use your own HTTP server, you have to be aware that the Jetty server will be launched. Most of ProActive examples are launched
  with the option '-Dproactive.http.port=8080' which specifies Jetty port. So, if you want to use your own server on port 8080, you have to modify the jetty port in
  launching scripts or to change the port of your own server.</para>

    <para>The steps for exporting and using an active object as a web service
    are the following:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>Write your active object in a classic way as below:</para>

			<programlisting language="java"><textobject><textdata fileref="automatic_snippets/webservices_AO_1.snip" /></textobject></programlisting>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
			<para>Once the element created and activated, a <emphasis role="bold">WebServicesFactory</emphasis> object has to be instantiated: </para>
			<programlisting language="java"><textobject><textdata fileref="automatic_snippets/webservices_AO_4.snip" /></textobject></programlisting>
			<para>or</para>
			<programlisting language="java"><textobject><textdata fileref="automatic_snippets/webservices_AO_5.snip" /></textobject></programlisting>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Then, you have to instantiate a <emphasis role="bold">WebServices</emphasis> object as follows: </para>
			<programlisting language="java">WebServices ws = wsf.getWebServices(myUrl);</programlisting>
			<para>If you want to use the local Jetty server to expose your active object, you can use the following line
			to retrieve the good URL:</para>
			<programlisting language="java">String myUrl = AbstractWebServicesFactory.getLocalUrl();</programlisting>
			<para>This will get the Jetty port which is a random port and build the url.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>And finally, you can used one of the <literal>WebServices</literal> methods: </para>
			<programlisting language="java"><textobject><textdata fileref="automatic_snippets/WebServices_Methods_AO.snip" /></textobject></programlisting>

        <para>where:</para>

  <section xml:id="exposeonremotejettyservers_29"><info><title>Exposing as a web service on remote Jetty servers launched during the deployment</title></info>
	<para>
		When you call the exposition of your active object,
		the CXF servlet is deployed on the local Jetty server.
		It is therefore possible to expose your object locally
		without doing anything else.
	</para>
	<para>
		Now, let us assume that your active object is deployed on a remote node.
		In that case, you have a running jetty server on the remote host containing this node but no servlet has been deployed on it.
		So, if you want to expose your active object on the remote host, you will have to make a small modification of the previous piece of code.
	</para>
	<para>
		The web service extension provides classes that implements the <literal>InitActive</literal> interface which are in charge of deploying the CXF servlet on the host
		where your object has been initialized. Thus, you just have to instantiate your active object using this implementation of <literal>InitActive</literal>.
	</para>

	<programlisting language="java"><textobject><textdata fileref="automatic_snippets/webservices_AO_7.snip" /></textobject></programlisting>

	<para>
		Now, let us assume that your active object is deployed on a node or locally and that you want to expose it on a host where another node is deployed.
		On this host, there is only a running Jetty server without any web services servlet.
		In order to deploy the CXF servlet on it, you can use the following code:
	</para>

	<programlisting language="java">WebServicesInitActiveFactory.getInitActive("cxf").initServlet(myNode);</programlisting>

	<para>
		Then, you can expose your active object as a web service as in <xref linkend="Stepstoexposeanactiveobjectasa_29"/>.
	</para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="Accessingtheservices_29"><info><title>Accessing the services</title></info>


    <para>Once the active object deployed, you can access it via any web service client (such as C#, SoapUI, Apache CXF API, Apache Axis2 API, ...) or
    with your favorite browser (only if the returned type of your service methods are primitive types).</para>

    <para>First of all, the client will get the WSDL file matching this active
    object. This WSDL file is the 'identity card' of the service. It contains
    the web service public interfaces and its location. Generally, WSDL files
    are used to generate a proxy to the service. For example, for a given
    service, say 'compute', you can get the WSDL document at <code>http://localhost:8080/proactive/services/compute?wsdl</code>.</para>

    <para>Now that this client knows what and where to call the service, it
    will send a SOAP message to the web server. The web server looks into the
    message and performs the right call. Then, it returns the response into another
    SOAP message to the client.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="Limitations_29"><info><title>Limitations</title></info>

    <para>Contrary to the previous version of the active object exposition using Apache SOAP, this new version which uses CXF can handle complex types.
	 That is, with this version, you can implement a service which exposes a method returning or taking in argument an instance of any class.
	 By using CXF and JAX-WS annotations, there is no limitation on the type of this class. It only implies to use the appropriate adapters (see the
	 <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://cxf.apache.org/docs/index.html">
		CXF documentation
	</link> for more details). However, if you do not want to use JAX-WS annotations or CXF, the class of this instance has to respect some criteria due
	 to the serialization and CXF/Axis2 restrictions:</para>
	 <itemizedlist>
		 <listitem><para>This class has to be serializable</para></listitem>
		 <listitem><para>This class has to supply a no-args constructor and preferably empty</para></listitem>
		 <listitem><para>All the fields of this class has to be private or protected</para></listitem>
		 <listitem><para>This class has to supply public getters and setters for each field.
		 These getter and setter methods have to be in this class and not in one of its super classes.</para></listitem>

    <section xml:id="HelloWorldwebservicecode_29"><info><title>Hello World web service code</title></info>


      <para>Let's start with a simple example, an Hello world active object
      exposed as a web service:</para>

      <programlisting language="java"><textobject><textdata fileref="automatic_snippets/webservices_AO_2.snip" /></textobject></programlisting>

      <para>The active object <literal>hw</literal> has been deployed as a web
      service on the web server located at
      <literal>http://localhost:8080/proactive/services/</literal> and its service name is
		<literal>"MyHelloWorldService"</literal>. The accessible service
      method are <literal>putTextToSayAndConfirm, putTextToSay and sayText</literal>.
		You can see its wsdl file through the
      <literal>http://localhost:8080/proactive/services/MyHelloWorldService?wsdl</literal> and you
      call the <literal>helloWorld</literal> method with your browser through, for example,
      <literal>http://localhost:8080/proactive/services/MyHelloWorldService/sayText</literal>.</para>


      <para>If you want to expose a method which requires arguments, you can call using the same link as previously but
      adding <literal>?[arg0]=[value]&amp;[arg1]=[value]...</literal> where [argn] is the name of the n-th argument
      as written in the wsdl file.</para>

		<para>You can also call a webservice using the ProActive client which uses a CXF client.
		Here is an example:</para>

      <para><link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/oasis/ProActive/apps/c3d.html">C3D</link>
      is a Java benchmark application that measures the performance of a 3D
      raytracer renderer distributed over several Java virtual machines using
      ProActive. C3D is composed of several parts: the distributed engine
      (renderers) and the dispatcher that is an active objet. This dispactcher
      permits users to see the 3D scene and to collaborate. Users can send
      messages and render command to this dispatcher. This enhancement of C3D
      is to send commands to the dispatcher from any language. To perform such
      an enhancement, the Dispatcher object must be exposed as a web service
      in order to a C# client for example controls it. Only one instruction
      has been added in the main method:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">WebServices.exposeAsWebService (dispatcher, "C3DDispatcher",
                    "http://localhost:8080",  new String [] {
                    "rotateRight", "getPicture", "rotateLeft", "rotateUp",
                    "rotateDown", "getPixels", "getPixelMax", "waitForImage",
                    "spinClock", "spinUnclock", "addRandomSphere", "resetScene",
                    "registerWSUser", "unregisterWSUser"
                });</programlisting>

      <para>Once the dispatcher is deployed as a web service, we have a WSDL
      url: <code>http://localhost:8080/proactive/servlet/id=C3DDispatcher</code>. It
      will be usefull to construct the dispatcher client.</para>

      <para>First of all, we have to generate the service proxy following the

    <section xml:id="Dispatchermethodscallsandcallbacks_29"><info><title>Dispatcher methods calls and callbacks</title></info>


      <para>C# client registers to the C3D dispatcher and then can send
      commands. C3D is a collaborative application. Indeed, when a client
      performs a call, all others users must be advised by the dispatcher.
      Although dispatcher can contact ProActive applications, it cannot
      communicate with other applications (it cannot initiate the
      communication). In other words, the dispacher must communicate remotely
      with an application written in another language.</para>

      <para>The answer to this problem is to use .Net web service on the C#
      user machine. Such a web service is waiting for callback requests that
      come from dispatcher. When receiving a request, the service sends it to
      the client via a .Net Remoting shared object. Thus, when the .Net web
      service receives a callback request, the C# client is updated thanks to
      propagated events.</para>
